Data and resources regarding meterorite strikes.

## Sources
The original source for this data is cited as http://osm2.cartodb.com/tables/2320/public#/map but that resource is no longer available.

The data here was converted from an Excel file posted here:
https://www.datavizualization.datasciencecentral.com/blog/registered-meteorites-that-has-impacted-on-earth-visualized

See also an analysis by Vincent Granville here:

The above analysis is a good introduction to the process of data science for aspiring students. Or even for people who are fans of meteorites.

### Visualizations
The original data visualization map has been taken offline as of Feb 2018 and I'll be working with Tableau Public to produce a new one.
Feb 21, 2018: My Tableau Public data visualization can be seen <a href="https://public.tableau.com/views/RegisteredMeteoriteStrikesImpactedonEarthsince1900/Map?:embed=y&:display_count=yes">here</a>
